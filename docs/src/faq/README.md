# 4. FAQs and Troubleshooting 

## As a Customer 
1. When I am at checkout/confirmation page and select “Pay with Wave Money”, do I need to enter full Wave Money Account Mobile Number? 

    - No, customer only required to enter Mobile Number prefix with ‘9’, mobile number prefix ‘0’ and country code ‘(+95)’ are not required. 

    - For e.g. 979100XXX

## As a Developer  
1. Is it Wave Money's responsibility for the communication between merchant client app & Merchant server app ? 
    - No. Communication between the client (merchant app) and the server (merchant server app) is the developer responsibility. 

2. Can I share Client_ID and Client_secret to public ? 
    - No, you should not share your Client_ID and Client_Secret to public, you must be kept secret and these details should never appear anywhere publicly, otherwise anyone could make transactions on your behalf. Wavemoney will not be held responsible for transactions not originating from your server.
